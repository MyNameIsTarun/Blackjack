# Blackjack
It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer.
Players do not compete against each other. 
It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.

Game funtionality:-
  Players are each dealt two cards,the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden).
  Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven.
  A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands.
  The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21.
  Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. 
  The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. 
  The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay.
  You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. 
  The detailed outcome of the hand follows:
    -If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.
    -If the player exceeds a sum of 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
    -If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not, the player wins.
    -If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust, the player wins.
    -If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum called a "push", no one wins.
